# Tiva C Launchpad Microcontrollers Training

Welcome to the Tiva C Launchpad Microcontrollers Training repository by Ahmed Hassabou, during the internship with Garraio Company. This repository is designed to provide you with a comprehensive learning experience in the world of microcontrollers, focusing on the Tiva C Launchpad development board. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository has something for everyone who wants to dive into embedded systems.

## What's Inside

- **ARM Architecture Fundamentals:** Lay a strong foundation by understanding the basics of the ARM architecture and its significance in the embedded world.

- **Tiva C Launchpad Introduction:** Get started with the Tiva C Launchpad development board. Learn about its components, how to set up your development environment, and begin writing your first program.

- **Peripherals Exploration:** Explore the vast array of peripherals that Tiva C offers. From GPIO control to UART communication, SPI interfacing to ADC conversion, you'll learn how to make the most of each peripheral.

- **Hands-On Projects:** Put your knowledge into action with a series of hands-on projects. Build LED blinking patterns, create sensor interfaces, establish communication between devices, and even delve into motor control applications.

- **Real-World Applications:** Discover practical applications of microcontrollers, from building IoT prototypes to controlling industrial machinery. Gain insights into how the Tiva C Launchpad can be used in diverse industries.

## Projects Description
### Session 1
1. Write a C code project to turn ON the white LED when switch 1 or switch 2 or both
of them are pressed, and the white LED should be turned OFF if all of the switches
are released.
### Session 2
1. Write a C code project to toggle the white LED each 500 ms using the SysTick timer,
one time using the registers, and another time using TivaWare library.
2. Write a C code project to toggle the white LED each 1000 ms using GPTM one time
using the registers, and another time using TivaWare library.
3. Write a C code project to toggle the white LED each 2500 ms using SysTick timer
using SysTick Interrupt and TivaWare library.
4. Write a C code project to develop the project mentioned in “Keypad_with_GPIO” lab
document, but you will make it work only using Interrupts. (You will need to buy a simple 4*4 keypad)
### Session 3
1. UART, make this project work on your board using UART 0:

2. ADC, make this project work on your board, send the voltage value to your PC using
UART 0: https://microcontrollerslab.com/adc-tm4c123g-tiva-c-launchpad-measureanalog-voltage-signal/
3. I2C, make this project work on your Tiva C board and another Arduino board:
